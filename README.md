#### Alpha v1.0.0
Love metasploit but want to use python more than ruby? Well, you're in luck!
DreamSploit is:
- Metasploit Inspired
- Pluggable
- Customizable
- and Easy To Use!

With support for python2 and python3, you'll only need to install termcolor and get started!
Using DreamSploit is easy but there is also support for custom modules!
Custom modules are easy to make and require only minimal knowledge for the simplest of python modules.
Plus, with a modules.json file, you can turn on and turn off modules at your own discretion.

DreamSploit is easy, custom, and as always, not for educational purposes only.
So make the switch to DreamSploit. Make the switch to the Dream Team.
